Using the cookiecutters
***********************


Available cookiecutters

Using a cookiecutter
--------------------

These instructions assume you have cloned this repository and are currently in its head dir. You will need a virtualenv for running the cookiecutter. You can discard it once the cookiecutter has made your new repo.

Commands::

    $ make requirements  # from inside edx-cookiecutter repo
    # Replace <OUTPUT-DIRECTORY> with the base directory; your new directory will go inside.
    $ cookiecutter -o <OUTPUT-DIRECTORY> <COOKIECUTTER-NAME>

TODOs after creating cookiecutter
--------------------------------

- Modify project README
- Modify project docs/decisions/0001-purpose-of-this-repo.rst ADR
